# Classification of Aggressive Driving Behavior from smartphone data

This project was developed for the Machine Learning Classification module of the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp at Metis.

The project proposal is available [here](https://github.com/hmlewis-astro/classify_aggressive_driving/blob/main/proposal.md).

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is available [here](https://github.com/hmlewis-astro/classify_aggressive_driving/blob/main/mvp.md).

The [description of the full code (with links to each script)](https://github.com/hmlewis-astro/classify_aggressive_driving/blob/main/final_pres/run_code.md), [write-up](https://github.com/hmlewis-astro/classify_aggressive_driving/blob/main/final_pres/final_writeup.md), and [slide deck](https://github.com/hmlewis-astro/classify_aggressive_driving/blob/main/final_pres/Lewis_classify_driving.pdf) are also available.
